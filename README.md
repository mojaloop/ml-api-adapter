The ml api adapter is a series of services that facilitate clearing and settlement of transfers between DFSPs, including the following functions:

- Brokering real-time messaging for funds clearing
- Maintaining net positions for a deferred net settlement
- Propagating scheme-level and off-transfer fees

The following documentation represents the services, APIs and endpoints responsible for various ledger functions.

## Deployment

See the [Onboarding guide](Onboarding.md) for running the service locally.

## Configuration

### Environment variables
The ml api adapter has many options that can be configured through environment variables.

| Environment variable | Description | Example values |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |


## API

For endpoint documentation, see the [API documentation](API.md).


## Logging

Logs are sent to standard output by default.

## Tests

Tests include unit, functional, and integration. 

Running the tests:


    npm run test:all


Tests include code coverage via istanbul. See the test/ folder for testing scripts.

## Auditing Dependencies

We use `npm-audit-resolver` along with `npm audit` to check dependencies for node vulnerabilities, and keep track of resolved dependencies with an `audit-resolve.json` file.

To start a new resolution process, run:
```bash
npm run audit:resolve
```

You can then check to see if the CI will pass based on the current dependencies with:
```bash
npm run audit:check
```

And commit the changed `audit-resolv.json` to ensure that CircleCI will build correctly.

## Container Scans

As part of our CI/CD process, we use anchore-cli to scan our built docker container for vulnerabilities upon release.

If you find your release builds are failing, refer to the [container scanning](https://github.com/mojaloop/ci-config#container-scanning) in our shared Mojaloop CI config repo. There is a good chance you simply need to update the `mojaloop-policy-generator.js` file and re-run the circleci workflow.
